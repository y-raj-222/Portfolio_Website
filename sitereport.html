            <h2>Development Experience</h2>
            <p>This portfolio project has been an enriching experience, allowing me to apply core web development concepts. I started by structuring the website using semantic HTML elements, ensuring proper organization and accessibility. Learning CSS for styling and responsiveness was an exciting challenge, as I experimented with layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid.</p>
            <p>During the process, I encountered difficulties in structuring the navigation bar and ensuring it adapted correctly on different devices. Additionally, debugging CSS conflicts was a time-consuming task, but with practice, I improved my problem-solving skills. Through iteration and testing, I enhanced the websiteâ€™s visual appeal and user experience.</p>

            <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
            <p>For the design, I opted for a modern, minimalistic style with a sans-serif font to enhance readability. I selected a color scheme that balanced professionalism and creativity, taking inspiration from design platforms such as <a href="https://www.behance.net/" target="_blank">Behance</a> and <a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="_blank">Dribbble</a>.</p>
            <p>Flexbox and Grid were used to structure content, allowing for a clean and adaptable layout. I also incorporated hover effects and smooth transitions to improve user interaction. Consistency was maintained across all pages by using a shared stylesheet, ensuring a seamless browsing experience.</p>

            <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
            <p>One of the primary challenges I faced was ensuring proper responsiveness across devices. Initially, the layout did not adjust well on smaller screens. I resolved this by implementing media queries and testing the website on multiple devices.</p>
            <p>Another challenge was ensuring cross-browser compatibility. Some CSS properties rendered differently on different browsers. To address this, I referenced MDN Web Docs and made adjustments to ensure consistent behavior across Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.</p>
            <p>Additionally, validating my code through W3C validators helped me identify and correct minor syntax errors, leading to a cleaner and more optimized website.</p>
