                <h2>Site Development Report</h2>

                <h3>Learning Experience</h3>
                <p>My journey into web development through this module has been both challenging and rewarding. As a computer science student at the University of Northampton, this was my first serious attempt at creating a complete website from scratch. The learning curve was steep, but each challenge helped me grow as a developer.</p>
                
                <p>Initially, I struggled with CSS layouts and responsive design. The concept of flexbox and grid systems seemed complex at first, but through consistent practice and referring to resources like <a href="https://css-tricks.com" class="reference-link">CSS-Tricks</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org" class="reference-link">MDN Web Docs</a>, I gradually became more comfortable with these concepts.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "One of my biggest achievements was implementing a fully responsive navigation menu that transforms into a hamburger menu on mobile devices - something I initially thought was impossible without JavaScript!"
                </blockquote>

                <h3>Development Process</h3>
                <p>I approached the development in several phases:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planning Phase (Week 1-2):</strong> Researched portfolio websites, created wireframes, and planned the content structure</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Development (Week 3-4):</strong> Set up the basic HTML structure and implemented the core CSS styling</li>
                    <li><strong>Responsive Design (Week 5-6):</strong> Adapted the layout for different screen sizes and implemented the mobile menu</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing & Refinement (Week 7-8):</strong> Conducted cross-browser testing and fixed various bugs</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
                <p>The design choices were influenced by modern portfolio websites and material design principles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Color Scheme:</strong> I chose a professional color palette with #2c3e50 (dark blue) and #3498db (light blue) as primary colors. These colors were inspired by the University of Northampton's brand colors and create a professional, academic feel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Typography:</strong> I selected 'Segoe UI' as the primary font for its excellent readability and modern appearance. The font stack includes fallbacks ensuring consistent display across different operating systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layout:</strong> The clean, minimalist layout was inspired by websites like <a href="https://www.awwwards.com" class="reference-link">Awwwards</a> and <a href="https://dribbble.com" class="reference-link">Dribbble</a>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
                <p>The biggest challenges I faced included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating a responsive navigation menu without JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Maintaining consistent spacing and alignment across different screen sizes</li>
                    <li>Ensuring proper contrast ratios for accessibility</li>
                    <li>Debugging cross-browser compatibility issues, especially with Firefox</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Implement dark mode functionality</li>
                    <li>Add more interactive elements using JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Improve page load performance</li>
                    <li>Add more project examples as I complete them</li>
